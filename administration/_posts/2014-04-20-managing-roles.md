About the form:

The new Role is now added to the list.

# Using the rights matrix

The rights matrix permits to allow or not the access of Users in a Role to Folders.
The `Red` cell indicates that the Role is not allowed to access the folder. And the `Green` one indicates that the Role has access to.

* ![Folders Icon]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mng_roles_7.png)

This matrix is very powerful and visible. As you can see in the previous screen-capture.

# Allow access to all Items

This feature is disabled by default and is unsecure but it may be helpful.

It's aim is to permit the Users of a Role to have the right to edit/modify all Items they have access to.
It will bypass the settings set for each Item.

<i class="fa fa-bullhorn" style="margin-right:10px;"></i> Only activate this for a Role with limited Users.

To activate this, click on the icon as shown in next screen-capture.
